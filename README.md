## Aim of the site

A website dedicated to showcase and inform users of the site of Katharine Anrold’s ability of circus as her art form. It is a website built to inform and show videos, images and examples of Katharine’s circus work and experience.

With the easy and simple fixed navigation menu, the user can traverse through Katharine’s work and life of circus to see if they would like to hire her for events, projects or enquire about upcoming queries in events and entertainment. With the use of high quality and effective images we are trying to draw the user in and wow them with her skills and abilities.

## UX

This is a website where the user can find information about the international circus artist Katharine Arnold.

* The visitors can submit their details to enquire about a job or event they might need Katharine’s skills for.
* The visitors can see a gallery of photos and links to video demonstrations of Katharine’s skills.
* The visitors can find out Katharine’s experience, work history and past projects.

In order to achieve this, the client wanted a website which meets the following criteria:

1. A 5 page website that included a strong but simple landing page, an About page to show a concise work history and projects she has collaborated on, A gallery highlighting skills and action shots of performance referenced in her about section, a video page to show full length acts easily to people enquiring; with risk assessment attached for technical requirements. Finally a contact page for people to be able to drop an enquiry. There is also a footer with targets to new pages of Katharine’s professional social media to showcase her talents more and give the visitor another platform to easily access. There is also an email link attached to her professional email, this also gives potential clients a chance to contact her directly if they need an immediate answer.
2. Plain simple black background, with vibrant and striking images theme the site, with white text to emphasise the simplicity of the site and focus more on the images and pops of colour the images produce.
3. Large amount of images with videos and video links to show rather than describe through text. Studies show bookers and producers usually want a quick way to access media to make a decision on whether they want to book a circus artist in the first minute of images and videos presented.
4. A concise but brief work history to highlight the best of Katharine’s career. Again the main career highlights have been picked out with a BOLD text to draw attention to them quicker if someone is doing a skim read of this history.
5. A form where the visitors can submit their details and comments to put forward queries to Katharine.

## Future Goals

* The Gallery to be more responsive in the sense of when you hover over and image they grow and expand with the scroll over. Then decrease to their original size when the scroll goes away from them.

* The use of maybe a video heading showcasing sharp, powerful and dynamic shots of Katharine’s showreel to grab attention as soon as people arrive on the landing page. Will have to use python and java script to achieve this.

## Testing

Initially I used the developer’s tools from Google Chrome to make sure the colours and the code was the correct and elements were showing up in a rough place, making sure the project look good on mobile devices first and build up from there.

I also used the tools below:

* W3 schools to help me with media queries and to also help with basic stylings in CSS as I forgot how to underline text without using html.
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp

* HTML formatter https://htmlformatter.com/ to format my HTML code so it’s easy to read.

* Photo editor online to blur the edges of a photo to make it more visually appealing in about section 
https://www.quickpicturetools.com/en/blur_edges/

*flex froggy to help me with flex positioning of elements.

Finally I tested the site on:
* Google Chrome Version 81.0.4044.122 (Official Build) (64-bit)
* Firefox Version 75.0 (64-bit)

### Issues and resolutions

During my first conversation with my mentor he pointed out about the header and nav, as well as positioning of elements throughout the site on various pages. He suggested Flexbox research to help me overcome positioning with flexbox capabilities. 

During the creation of the different feature I came across some issues:

* Positioning of elements I was using absolute positioning a lot throughout which would not be responsive with media queries and scaling down to different devices. After trial and error and research on Flexbox and W3 schools I was able to position elements throughout my site how I wanted them to appear on the pages, as well as enable them to be scaled up and down for various devices.

* The header and nav were originally fixed by myself through HTML coding and CSS stylings, however after them proving difficult to arrange other elements on the page without JS queries and making scaling to different devices difficult. I decided to go onto Bootstrap to use their fixed navbar setting to make scaling easier.


* When I coded the http links for the social icons, the icons turn blue instead of the the white as intended. This was easily rectified by adding color:white to the icons class. As well as creating a class for the hover stylings over link elements so that there was not a blue highlight when hovering over them.
